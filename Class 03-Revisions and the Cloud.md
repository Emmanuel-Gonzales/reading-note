## Git

Git is a program that takes a screenshot with every change and document them. Each change is called a commit. **GitHub** is a program that uses git along with other features. Github groups files into a **repository**

## Local vs. Remote

GitHub stores files remotely, ie online. Some programmers prefer their files to be local and code offline. Using Ubuntu, we transfer repositories from github to a local text editor and vice versa

## How to Move files from Remote to Local and Back

* Find the type **Git Clone** then type the https link to the repository

* After coding do the ACP Method
  * Type **git status** to get the file status
  * **git add <filename>**
  * **git commit -m(message)**
  * **git origin main**
