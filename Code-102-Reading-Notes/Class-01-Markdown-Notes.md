# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a program used to write html code in a much simplified manner. The syntax is much simpler than html, and there are less rules. As beginners we use markdown first because it's easier than most programing languages. However, It can't do as much as HTML and CSS.

## Markdown Syntax

* ### Use this symbol to write headers. I goes from one to six.

* To write paragraphs just type, no extra syntax needed.
* lists are made with -, +, or*
  - Sub lists are made by indenting under an existing list

* To add a break in the paragraph just skip a line in the code

* Text can be made **bold** using ( ** ) or 
*italicized* using (*), 
* A [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kEzW3MgKm8) Is created by typing the "word" in [ ] then (url)"
* And much more
