# HTML

HTML is a markup language used to design web pages. It's one of the more basic coding languages and is meant to act the skeleton of a website.

## Syntax

The content on a page are clarified by **elements**. The elements are used to tell HTML what the words are supposed to be. An element is surrounded by pointy brackets <>.

Example: < header > content </ header >

## Structure 

A web page is segmented into boxes. Each box is set up by the indents on the page. If a section of content is indented under the content above it, it's inside that box.

< header >

    < h1 >
    
    < nav >
        
        < p >
        
        </p >
    
    </nav >

< /header >

## Things I want to know

Is there a use for HTML outside of desining web pages like there is with JavaScript
