# Programing with JavaScript

## Function

A JavaScript function is a section of code that is saved and is executed whenever it's called by name. The syntax of a 
function is "function "name" (parameters) {code to execute}". This command saves the function under the "name" and executes the code in the curly brackets {} whenever the name is typed. You can use this create loops by placing the function name inside the function itself.
