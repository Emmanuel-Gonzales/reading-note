# Operators and Loops

## What are Operators?

An Operator is a special symbol that performs operations (actions) on the operands (values and variables). An operator can preform an action to an operand change it or evaluate it.

### Assignment Operators

Assinment operators assigns a value to the left operand based on the value of its right operand.

* = assinment - Changes the value on the left to be the value on the right

* =+ addition assinment - add the two values and makes the left value the sum

* =- subtraction assinment - subtract the two values and makes the left value the difference

* + plus - adds the values

* && Logical AND - combinds the values, gives then the same boolean

* || logical OR - combindes the values under the some boolean

### Comparison Operator

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

*  == - equal

* === - strict equal

* !== - strict not equal

* < - greater than

* <= - greater than or equal to

## What are Loops?

Just as it sounds, a command that repats itself depending on the input

### While loops

while (condition is true){execute the code}

the loop repeats until the "condition" becomes false

### "for" loops

for (initial value; condition to evaluate; increment){execute the code}

Repeats only for a set number of times
