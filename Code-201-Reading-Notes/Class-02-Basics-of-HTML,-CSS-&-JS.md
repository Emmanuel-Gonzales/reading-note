# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Intro to HTML

* **Semantic** elements are used to divide up the page, they are useful to the browser and the developer. Semantic tags are used to divide the page into sections based on the content inside. < header >
tags usually contain the title and navigation of the page, the < body > contains the all of the viewable page, the < footer > is the bottom etc.

* There are 6 levels of **headings** in HTML.

* The < sub > and < sup > tags are used when you want to shrink a piece of text next to a word. < sub > places the text at the bottom of the sentence and < sup > places the text at the top. They are used for marking up item next to dates chemical numbers and more. EX: 25**th** or CO**3**.

* < abbr > is used with abbreviations and acronyms if the developer adds the **title** value to < abbr >, plus the full version of the word, it will allow the user to see the full word of the abbreviation by hovering the mouse over the word.  

EX:  This is the < abbr title="Abbreviation" >abb< /abbr > of a word.

## Learn CSS

  * **External** - Placing a < link > tag in the < head > section and pasting a link to a seperate CSS file
 
  * **Inline** - Using a style atribute inside a HTML tag

* You want to stay away from using inline styles as much as posible because it involves mixing CSS and HTML code together making harder to read
