# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Lists

An Unordered List is used when the items in your list don't have an order they need to be in.

To change the bullet type in an unordered list you need to go in the CSS file and use the "list-style-type" on the list items.

You should use an Ordered List when the items you want to list need to be numbered or set in a type of order; and an Unordered list when you don't care what order your list items are in.

To change the numbers you need to use the "type" property in an encloses li element.

## CSS Box Model

The Box Model: In Washington D.C, the President lives. The secret service is his **padding** ment to protect him from the world. The White House is his **margin** where hes free to walk around and do his duties.

* Content - The item itself, created in the HTML.

* Padding - The space inbetween the content and border.

* Border - The box around the content, the content, padding and border is how much space the object takes up.

## Control Flow with JS

Arrays can hold any data type

The people in the array is valid and you acsses the data by typing console.table().

Operators

* (=) - Assignment assigns a variable to an object.

* (+=) - Adds the value to the right and assigns the variable to the sum.

* (-=) - Subtracts the value to the right and assigns the variable to the result.

* (&&=) - Only assigns if the right is truthy

* (||=) - Only assingns value if the right is falsy

let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

 The sum of this is "10dog" because false is a boolean so 10 + false makes 10 false and 10 + dog creates the string "10dog"

A conditional statement could be used if you have a prompt and you want to want to display a different outcome bases on the answer.

A loop is usefull if you have a prompt and you want to keep looping the prompt until the user types the correct prompt.
