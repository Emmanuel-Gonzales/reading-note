# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

To create a link, wrap text inside an < a > element with a href element. The href attribute contains the web address (link)

You can put an english tag in the < head > section so other languages can translate.

## CSS Layout

Normal layout is the way the HTML elements are placed in the browser without you making any changes to the CSS.

Block-level elements take up the entire horizontal space of the container its in while inline elements only take up the space of the content its in.

Static positioning is the default for every html element.

When you put an element in absolute positioning, the element no longer exists in the normal stage flow. The element it placed on a layer above the page and can move freely around the page without worry for the other elements.

Absolute position fixes an element in place while fixed position fixes an element based on the viewport window.

## JavaScript Functions

Declaring a function is creating a function and invocation is placing the function in your code so it runs.

Parameters and arguments are similar but parameters are in the parenthasis and assin values to the objects inside the function. Arguments are more similar to arrays.

## Pair Programing

Pair is helpful because it gives you an extra set of eyes you. Any mistakes or obsticals you can lean on your partner for help. You can also practice your speaking and articulating skills.

## Things I want to know more about

I still have work to do to fully understand the positions.
