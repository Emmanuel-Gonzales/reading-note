# Objects and the Dom

- An object is a variable that is assigned imformation. An object stores imformation (usualy about the word it's assigned to) and can be looked at when the object is called.

- Creating an object literal is convenient because you can assign speciffic imformation to custom names so it's easier to to call which property you want.

- The imformation in arrays are called indexes and are labelled numerically starting from 0. To call index 0 the syntax would be "array[0]" The imformation in objects are called properties and are labelled by names that the user gives it. To call the "name" property you would type "object.name".

- Dot notaion the one thats mainly used but bracket notation is also used in some curcumstansis. For example, if the object property name is held in a variable of if it needs to be uses in a function.

- "this." refers to the the object literal that it's currently in. `${this.name} is my name` would print the 'name' property of the object that the phrase lives in.

## Intro to DOM

- DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's a programming interface for web documents that allows programs to interact and make changes to web pages.

- DOM is not apart of JavaScript, it's a seperate API. It was made to be able to interact with any language but is mainly used with JavaScript.
