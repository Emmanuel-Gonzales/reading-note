# CSS Layout

## Flexbox

Flexbox is used for one dimentional content, meaning it can display images in rows or colums, but not at the same time.

The main axis is set by the flex-direction property. The other axis then becomes the cross axis.

Flex box can negativly effect negatively impact accessibility. If the flow of items flows in incorrect order it can be hard for people to read or understand.

Flexbox is is better than float because a float property would have trouble centering a block of content inside its parent, making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available space, or making all colums the same height.

Overall the use of flexbox definitly make it eaisier to syle webpages to look more presentable.
