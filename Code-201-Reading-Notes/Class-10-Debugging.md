# Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

A syntax error is a mistake in the spelling causing of code causing it not to run. A logic error is when the code runs sucsessfuly, but it dosesn't do what the user intends because of their misunderstanding.

A lot of the errors I occur on are syntax errors. Sometimes I know what I want to do I just dont know the correct commands to get them. And sometimes I just do typos on basic english words.

In the future I can use console.log's spell, spell checks and other people to help me debug to debug my work.

## The JavaScript Debugger

The JavaScript debugger is a tool built in the browser that allows you to view and inspect you JavaScript. You can set breakpoints in your code, which is the line your code that you want the code to pause execution. Another feature are call stacks, the Call stack section shows which code was executed to get to the line of code your currently on.
