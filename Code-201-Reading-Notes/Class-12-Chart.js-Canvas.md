# Canvas and Charts.js

## Canvas

The < canvas > tag allows the developer to draw simple 2D shapes in their webpages. It can be used in the HTML but also using DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

Canvas uses attributes in the tag itself, like img tags, but unlike img tags < canvas > requires a  closing < /canvas > tag. All content in between the tags is fallback content in case the browser doesn't support canvas.

Initially  the canvas is blank. To add content you need to use the getContex() method in JavaScript to determine which style you'll draw in. Ex. getContent(2d);

## Chart.JS

Chart.js is a charting library that can be used with canvas to create charts. It has multiple custom plugins that add intracability to your webpage, like creating annotations, zooming, or drag-and-drop functionalities to name a few things.

It can create different types of charts like line charts, area charts, bubble charts or even mixed charts.

Charts are better to use because they are newer and nicer to look at then tables, and more practical.

Chart.js can take the data that you already have and make it more interactive and look newer.
