# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## CSS Transforms

With the Transform command users can now effect elements in new ways. Like rotating, growing, shrinking, scaling, stretching, and much more.

Transforms can be used to skew shapes all around. You can use Perspective or Perspective Depth Value to make text look like the opening of a Star Wars Movie.

## Transitions & Animations

Transitions allows the developer to change the state of an element by interactiong with it. Like changing shape or rotating the image when you hover your mouse over it.

A Transition is different from an Animation because a transition requires some user input (a hover or click) while an animation will move by itself.

Transitions spice up your website and add interactivity. It can allow your website to stand out among others with users. Mabey it can be used to show off your css capabilities to employers.
