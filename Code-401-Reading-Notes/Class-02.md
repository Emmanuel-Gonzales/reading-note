# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## Intro to Nodejs and Express

Middleware is software that is used as a bridge inbetween other softwares and allows them to work together.

Express is the most popular framework and middleware library

Express is unopinionated which means the dont belive there is a "right way of solving a problem". This means they design their program to be flexible and allows the user to solve problems any way they want.

A module is a software that can be used in Node.js with other code. It's importants that a software is modular so that it's benefits are other software benifets.

## NPM

I am currently running npm version 9.6.4 on my computer.

To install a program named jshint you would type "npm install -g jshint" into your comand line.

## Tests

Tests are are used to test functionality in code using node.js. It lets the developers know that their code is working. It's a way of checking your work with less steps.

Developers have reported that writing tests into their code has led to lower mistakes overall in their code. This means that developers spent less effort in the final stages of the program. It also was reported to lead to higher quality code in the end.

Some common mistakes people make when writing tests are not testing frequently enough tests and making their tests to critical.

When using tests in a team, some common mistakes are too few developers actually using the test and the test not being maintained over time.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration leads to smaller code changes faster release rate and more test readability.

Continuos Delivery is updating the content regularly before deployment and Continuous Deployment updating after depoyment.

Github allows multiple programers to work on the same project and make changes at the same time.
