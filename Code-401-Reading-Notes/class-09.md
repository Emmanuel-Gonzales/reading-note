# Authorization/Authentication

1. Create a eBay like website that allows users to sell and buy items. When they sign in they can choose to be a buyer, seller, admin. Etc. Sellers can use an item schema to post items they want to sell, update the item they want, and delete the item if they don't want to sell. and buyer can look up items items only. Admin can update and delete only.

2. A Taxi service where a user can signup as a driver, passenger, watcher, and admin. Passengers can post their pickup requests (address, Route time, tip, and pickup time), they can also update. Drivers can see  pickup requests but cant delete or add them.
