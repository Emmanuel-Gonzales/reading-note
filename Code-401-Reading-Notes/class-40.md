# Frameworks

Next and Gatspy are both React Frameworks meant to add features and components to React.

## Next.js

Next.js Has built in routing and api functionality. `fetch()` is a built in method with next.js that allows developers to `get` information from an api. Next also has built in routing functionality, you have the ability to create routes by using the file system in the app folder.

## Gatsby.js

Gatsby.js is another framework with lots of features. Gatsby has a deploy service that you can use to deploy sites to the cloud from your repository. It also has different ways to display data, GraphiQL is a tool that is used to structure graph queries in your site.

## Learning More

Moving forward I would like to have the ability to learn React frameworks quickly for more job flexibility.
